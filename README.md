 Unit Byte Assignment UI design using Animation with Jetpack Compose

 Sorry but I couldn't find the exact animation anywhere on the internet so I decided to import an animation from LottieFiles which has free animations that you can choose from rest of it , I have created the UI as defined in the Google form using Jetpack Compose (though I have just started using Jetpack so it was a nice experiance doing this designing in a time constraint.)

 The clock animation application developed using Kotlin , LootieFiles and Jetpack Compose.

Screen Shot of the UI is in the issues section
